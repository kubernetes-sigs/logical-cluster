# logical-cluster

A set of APIs to improve the Kubernetes user experience for cluster administration by
offering utilities to interact with fleet of clusters which can be managed by
Cluster API, or other entities (like cloud providers).

The goal of the repository is going to be to provide high level interfaces and
tools to generate clients to interact with many clusters, provide a simple bridge
with Controller Runtime, and define common set of tools.
